### ‚ö° Zuexiang (ZX / ZueX / YueliangX)

**Zuexiang** is a personal fork of [Yueliang](http://yueliang.luaforge.net/), a Lua 5.1 bytecode compiler.  

This is not a production-grade compiler ‚Äî more like a fun playground that sometimes works well and sometimes explodes.  
Still, it's fast, and the syntax extensions can be useful if you're into that.

---

### ‚ú® Features (Added or Tweaked)

- `continue` support
- `goto` + labels
- Compound assignment (`+=`, `-=`, etc.)
- `!=` as alias for `~=`
- Luau-style number literals (`1e3`, `0xFF`, etc.)
- Ternary expressions in `local` declarations
- Integer division operator (`//`)
- Still outputs standard Lua 5.1 bytecode
- Performance is decent

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations

- Comments are stripped (not supported in parsing stage)
- The codebase is messy ‚Äî I wrote most of it in bursts
- Not very optimized (instruction count and compiler size)
- Some identifiers are just `x`, `f`, etc. ‚Äî sorry, I got lazy

In short: it runs, it compiles, but don‚Äôt expect clean architecture.

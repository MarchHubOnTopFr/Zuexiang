### ‚ö° Zuexiang (ZX / ZueX / YueliangX)

**Zuexiang** is a personal fork of [Yueliang](https://github.com/jnwhiteh/luajit-yueliang), a Lua 5.1 bytecode compiler.  

This is not a production-grade compiler ‚Äî more like a fun playground that sometimes works well and sometimes explodes.  
Still, it's fast, and the syntax extensions can be useful if you're into that.

---

### ‚ú® Features (Added or Tweaked)

- `continue` support
- `goto` + labels
- Compound assignment (`+=`, `-=`, etc.)
- `!=` as alias for `~=`
- Luau-style number literals (`1e3`, `0xFF`, etc.)
- Ternary expressions in `local` declarations
- Integer division operator (`//`)
- Still outputs standard Lua 5.1 bytecode
- Performance is decent (see benchmark below)

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations

- Comments are stripped (not supported in parsing stage)
- The codebase is messy ‚Äî I wrote most of it in bursts
- Not very optimized (instruction count and compiler size)
- Some identifiers are just `x`, `f`, etc. ‚Äî sorry, I got lazy

In short: it runs, it compiles, but don‚Äôt expect clean architecture.

### üìä Benchmark (vs Original Yueliang)

Sample test input:

| Metric            | Zuexiang       | Yueliang       |
|------------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| Compile Time            | ~0.29s    | ~1.92s   |
| Bytecode Size            | 86.7 KB  | 144 KB   |
| Sub-functions            | 229          | 229         |
| Constants                   | 448         | 448          |
| Instructions                | 1450       | 1419       |
